# Pirate Themed WPM App
 Made for my User Interface and Design Class


In this repository is the code of the current version of the app and a folder of images taken while the app was running.

The app is a pirate-themed WPM app, that has three different modes:


Race - Complete the text race before the timer runs out to win

Timer - Type as many words as possible before the timer runs out to get a WPM count

Word Count - Type the popular quote as fast as you can to get a new best time


This app also contains three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, which modify length and difficulty of characters introduced.
